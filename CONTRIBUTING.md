# Contributing to Minter Js SDK

FunFaSy welcomes help in many forms including development, code review, documentation improvements, and outreach.

## Using Github issues and pull requests

Some repositories have specific issue templates that will be helpful for maintainers and community contributors. 
Please use the templates whenever available.

Please include steps to reproduction, if reporting an error. Information on all applicable versions is quite helpful.
Some versions can be found using the command line. (For example: `node --version` or `rustc --version`.) 
Other version information may be packaged as dependencies. (For example: in `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`.)

If there are verbosity flags available, please include those to offer as much information as possible.

When opening a pull request, please use the typical open-source flow of forking the desired repository and opening a pull request from your forked repository. 

## Testing

Please note that for technical contributions, FunFaSy runs a battery of continuous integration tools and tests for each pull request.

It's encouraged to write unit tests on new features. Many FunFaSy repositories have built-in scripts that run tests locally. Tests may check linting and must be addressed.

For this repository, please follow testing directions outlined in the `README.md` file.
